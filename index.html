  const text = "I'm a second-year Computer Science student at IPB University. My journey in the world of IT might seem a little different, but it's been pretty normal in other ways. I'm pretty new to studying this field in depth. Ever since I started college, I've been blown away by how technology can solve complex problems. But recently, I've found that my interests are really converging on one field that feels super relevant: data science. For me, data science isn't just about numbers or statistics, it's about the story behind each set of data. It's all about spotting patterns, uncovering hidden insights, and using that info to make better decisions. I think data is like a universal language that can explain things in different areas, like business, health, and the environment. As a beginner, I know this path isn't easy. There's a lot to learn, like programming languages like Python and R, understanding machine learning algorithms, and data visualization skills. I've been working on improving my data science skills lately. My goal is simple: to become someone who can take abstract data and make it more accessible and understandable for those around me. I think that if I put my mind to it and stay curious, I can really make a name for myself in this field and contribute something valuable down the road. This journey is just beginning, but I'm eager to explore more and learn how data can be processed and used.";
